# XCode_MusicCollectionApp

Upload of a project created in XCode to run on Apple devices. The class and the application both were designed to demonstrate basic elements of UI/UX design. The application was designed to be primarily used on a phone, but it automatically adjusts the contents of each page/view  to fit the device in a visually appealing way.
